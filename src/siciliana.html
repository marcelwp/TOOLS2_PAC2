                    La defensa siciliana, jugada per primera vegada l'any 1592 a Palermo, és una defensa per peces negres molt potent.

            El fonament de la defensa és avançar el peó a la posició c5 com a resposta de l'obertura del peó a e4.

            The Sicilian Defense is the most popular defense against white’s opening 1.e4 and is used extensively at top level play. It is a very aggressive defense and immediately stakes claim at the center, denying white the double pawns on e4 and d4. Many chess champions actually prefer to start with 1.d4 because of how well the Sicilian Defense plays against 1.e4.

            Eventually the c-pawn of black is usually exchanged, opening the semi-open c file for black to bring his queen or rook to and add pressure to the queen side attack.

            White not only has to worry about black’s defense but also the counter attack that the Sicilian Defense presents. White tends to have the advantage on the king side while black will usually look to attack on the queen side.

            For those chess players that play against the 1.e4 opening quite often, the Sicilian Defense is an opening that you should spend quite a bit of time studying. There are many variations and they each are designed for specific types of players.
